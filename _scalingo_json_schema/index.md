# scalingo.json Schema

`scalingo.json` is a deployment manifest to let people deploy their software
super easily. This document describe its schema in detail.

--- row ---

## The manifest

This document describes how to write a JSON manifest file which
will be interpreted by our platform when someone wants to deploy a project.
The file must be located at the root of the project and be named either `app.json`
or `scalingo.json`. The latter will always take priority over the first one.

This JSON manifest is read when deploying a review app or a [one-click
deploy](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/one-click-deploy).

All attributes are optional.

**The manifest attributes**

{:.table}
| field                     | type    | description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------  | ---------------------------------------------- |
| name                      | string  | Complete name of the project                   |
| repository                | string  | Location of the GIT repository of the project  |
| ref                       | string  | Branch name or commit ID of the code to use    |
| stack                     | string  | Name of the stack to use                       |
| description               | string  | Description in one or two sentences of the app |
| logo                      | string  | URL to the logo of the project                 |
| website                   | string  | Official website of the application if any     |
| copy_parent_database_urls | boolean | Copy database credentials from parent app      |
| env                       | object  | Environment of the application, see below      |
| addons                    | array   | List of all the addons required to run the app |
| scripts                   | object  | Optional hook scripts, see below               |
| formation                 | object  | Formation of containers when an app is created |

**Environment**

The keys of the environment object are the name of the variables you want to
add.

{:.table}
| field          | type   | description                                       |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `VAR_NAME`     | string | key of the object is the name of the env variable |

Each of these keys has to respect the following properties:

{:.table}
| field          | type    | description                                                           |
| -------------- | ------  | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| description    | string  | Description of the variable to explain what it does                   |
| value          | string  | (if no generator) Default value of the variable                       |
| generator      | string  | (if no value) Use a generator to define a default value               |
| template       | string  | (if generator is 'url' or 'template') Template to generate value from |
| required       | boolean | Mandatory to fill the value before deploying the one-click            |

_Note: supplying `null` or an empty string to `value` will remove the variable from the environment. It can be used to delete environment variables present in the parent app._

Three generators are available `secret`, `template` or `url`:

* `secret`: generates a unique token as a default value of the variable.
  Useful for instance when one need to generate a unique encryption seed key,
  example: `90ffea2d3071e8d86cafb89ff5060883`

* `template`: generates an environment variable based on the content of
  the `template` field. The following tokens are substituted dynamically
  by the expected values when surrounded by `%`:

  * `APP`
  * `PARENT_APP`
  * `PR_NUMBER`

  Example: If the review app being deployed is `my-app-pr10`:

  * `Pull Request Number %PR_NUMBER%` -> `Pull Request Number 10`

* `url`: automatically inserts the URL of the application after its deployment.
  When this generator is used, the `template` property is taken into
  account, the token `%URL%` can be used to be replaced by the created app URL.

}
```

**Addons**

If no `addons` key is specified, the default behaviour is to duplicate the
addons from the parent application.

The _addons_ field contains an array of object describing the addons you need to
deploy for your review app. The object must have the following properties:

{:.table}
| field    | type   | description                           |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| plan     | string | Plan of the addon of the review app   |
| options  | object | Various options regarding the addon   |

The `plan` uses the format `addon-name:plan-id`. E.g.
`mongodb:mongo-starter-256` or `redis:redis-sandbox`.

The only `options` field is `version` which contains the version to deploy (e.g.
`4.0.16-1`).

--- row ---

**Formation**

The formation is the definition of the container which will be started once the
application is deployed. (Either coming from a one-click deployment button, or
a review app from the GitHub integration)

It should be a map of container type definitions, the key should be the type name
and the value should have the following structure:

{:.table}
| field    | type    | description                                                            |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| amount   | integer | Number of containers to start once the application is deployed         |
| size     | string  | Container size `name` ([get the list of sizes](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/internals/container-sizes)) |

Get the default list of sizes on the <a target="_blank" href="https://scalingo.com/pricing">pricing page</a>.

Example:

```json
{
  "formation": {
    "web": {
      "amount": 2,
      "size": "L"
    },
    "worker": {
      "amount": 1,
      "size": "XL"
    }
  }
}
```

--- row ---

**Scripts**

> The `scripts.postdeploy` key is now deprecated in favor of postdeploy hook in the `Procfile`. More information
> on the [dedicated page](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/app/postdeploy-hook).

{:.table}
| field          | type   | description                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| postdeploy     | string | Command and arguments of the script you want to execute after each deployment.                  |
| first-deploy   | string | Job to run as postdeploy hook at the first deployment of a review app or one-click deployed app |

You can get more information on this feature on the [dedicated page](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/app/review-apps#run-a-task-after-the-first-deployment-of-a-review-app).

## Example

This example comes from a concrete project located [on Github](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini/tree/dev-oneclick).

With the `scalingo.json` in the above-mentioned project, the example will:

* Define the name of the project.
* Describe in a sentence the purpose of the project.
* Location of the logo.
* URL of the GIT repository.
* Official website of the project.
* List of the environment variables with their description and optional generator `VAR_TEST_1` and `VAR_SECRET_1`.
These environment variables will be available for your application.
* Ask for the provisioning of a Redis addon.
* Execute the provided script after the container booted.
